4SLAP - Simple, Suboptimal System Solving Library Aiming for Precision

A library containing tools for solving linear systems of equations. It
is meant to be easily usable, not necessarily efficient, and most
importantly: the solutions should be perfect. This means the user can
receive a solution x to the equation Mx = v, where M is a matrix and v
is a vector, such that x will only contain rational entries - no
decimal approximations!
